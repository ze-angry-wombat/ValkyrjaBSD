# ValkyrjaBSD
ValkyrjaBSD is a custom FreeBSD-Current distribution designed with the future development needs of Alfheim Industries in mind.  It has some clear goals as oulined below.  Being a FreeBSD distribution most of the distribution is governed by the FreeBSD COPYING file, typically a BSD or similar license is applied to the code.  Any code that is contributed through this project (build-scripts, installer, package manager) is governed by the LICENSE file.

## Goals
*** Enlightenment DE
*** Custom Package Manager (handles both binary and source installs)
*** Custom GUI System Installer
*** HAMMER2 Filesystem
*** Rust toolchain
*** GNU free (FreeBSD is already making strides in this and that is why this OS was chosen as the base)
